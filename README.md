# SignalVault

**Enterprise-grade AI system for organizational linguistic analysis and cultural turbulence detection**

---

## Overview

SignalVault is an AI-powered platform designed to scan, interpret, and visualize hidden patterns within high-velocity organizational communication. By analyzing ambient data from email threads, Slack logs, and meeting transcripts, SignalVault generates resonance heatmaps that reveal the semantic coherence and emotional stability of different organizational units over time.

Unlike traditional analytics tools, SignalVault operates as a **symbolic stabilizer for organizational cognition** - detecting cultural turbulence early, clearly, and without blame.

## Core Capabilities

### üß† Linguistic Coherence Engine
Models shared symbolic alignment across internal communication channels, tracking how teams maintain consistent messaging and cultural understanding.

### üìä Entropy Monitor  
Detects rising language fragmentation, passive tone masking, and dissonant framing patterns that indicate organizational stress before it surfaces in performance metrics.

### üó∫Ô∏è Resonance Heatmap Visualizer
Displays real-time organizational health through intuitive thermal visualizations showing areas of high and low symbolic coherence across teams, time periods, and project zones.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Semantic Warning System
Issues early alerts when emotional or mission alignment degrades, providing leadership with predictive insights into organizational stability.

### üìà Interpretive Dashboard
Context-aware insights designed for executive decision-making - not raw metrics, but narrative-driven intelligence that helps leadership understand the internal symbolic state of their organization.

## Key Features

- **Zero Individual Tracking**: Analyzes organizational patterns while maintaining complete user anonymization
- **Real-time Processing**: Monitors communication streams continuously for immediate pattern detection
- **Enterprise Security**: Full data encryption and secure processing pipelines
- **Executive Interface**: Clean, interpretive UI designed for non-technical leadership teams
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built for high-pressure, high-scale enterprise environments

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library
- **Data Visualization**: Custom heatmap and coherence visualization components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Styling**: CSS3 with advanced gradients and animations

## Core Analysis Metrics

SignalVault tracks several proprietary linguistic indicators:

- **Metaphor Density**: Frequency and consistency of symbolic language usage
- **Pronoun Distribution**: Shifts between collective vs. individual language patterns  
- **Modal Compression**: Changes in certainty and commitment language
- **Sentiment Entropy**: Emotional coherence across communication streams
- **Narrative Disruption**: Breaks in organizational storytelling consistency

## Security & Privacy

- **Complete Anonymization**: No individual user data is stored or tracked
- **Organizational Focus**: Analysis operates at team/department/company levels only
- **Secure Processing**: All linguistic analysis happens in encrypted, isolated environments
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies with automatic purging

## Use Cases
